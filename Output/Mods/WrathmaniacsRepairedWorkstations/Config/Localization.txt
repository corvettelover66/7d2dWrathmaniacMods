loadingTipRepairedWorkstations,UI,Loading Screen,New,"Repaired workstations cannot be crafted without the parts obtained from their destroyed counterparts. They may be unlocked immediately but they are not cheap. You will need to find and break down 5 to 10 forges just for the parts required to build one. This can be mitigated with each rank of Advanced Engineering, which reduces the amount of parts needed for each station."
