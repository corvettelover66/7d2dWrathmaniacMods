resourceRawCopperToolTip,Journal Tip,,New,Copper is not easily mined and has a fairy complex refining process. First you must break down the raw copper in a cement mixer to seperate the heavier minerals and extract out the copper. Then the raw copper mix must be taken to a campfire or chemistry station to be refined into usable scrap copper using a Lead-Silver anode.
