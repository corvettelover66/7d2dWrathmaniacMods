miningstationDesc,blocks,Block,New,"The Mining Station is a piece of technological beauty, capable of finding and mining any resource deep below the surface. Basic ores can be mined immediately but rare ores such as lead and iron require mining chips.  Supports up to five augers, each auger added reduces the mining time of any resource.\n\n[AF1E19] Warning[-]: overloading the Auto Miner output will cause gas overflows and you will lose both resources and gas."

miningstationToolTip,Journal Tip,,New,"Mining stations are advanced machines that require a lot of materials to build but are capable of mining ores easily using gasoline. The machine works similiarly to a campfire able to equipping both mining chips and extra augers as tools. The mining chips are necessary to find rare ores, without one the mining station can only mine rock, and clay. Augers are purely optional, as there is one built in, though any extra auger on the machine speeds up ore mining by 10%."

resourceIronOreMinerChipToolTip,Journal Tip,,New,"Mining chips are a necessary tool for the mining station to be fully equipped. Impossible to craft, though findable in mining terminals and destroyed mining stations. Without the correct mining chip, a mining station is unable to locate and mine rare ores.\n\nThere are 5 mining chips, one for each rare ore: Iron, Lead, Potassium Nitrate, Coal, and Shale."
