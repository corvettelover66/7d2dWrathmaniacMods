It is possible to install this mod in an existing save but doing so requires the In game console and Reseting Chunks frequently. 
This will require you to open terminal a lot during your current playthrough, though you won't have to type or remember much, you have been warned. If that sounds like a burden and you install mid-save then you will be unable to find mining chips easily as Mining Terminals will not offer the option to loot. Obviously this is not an issue in a new game.

I have tested the steps below in my own game and observed no issues. 
That being said I am no expert on the inner workings of 7d2d, I cannot guarantee "there won't be issues" sometime down the road.
I tested the commands, they will update the Mining Terminals correctly and the Player built based is untouched. 

WARNING: To attempt this installation mid-playthrough you must first backup your save BEFORE installing the mod. The typical location is: C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\7DaysToDie\Saves
	It should be noted that by overwriting the Saves folder in the AppData location with copied, previously save data to effectively "Load" a previous save.

TO OPEN TERMINAL (In Game command console): Type F1

Steps:
1) Backup your save 
	- These can get big it is usually better to find the folder with the specfic game desired to be saved, it will be the name given and seen when continuing in the main menu.
	- Just make sure when "Loading" the save you put the folder copied (with all the save data) back in the right place.

WHEN TO PERFORM STEPS 2-4: if you are close to a POI you want to loot. 

2) Step into the building. You really just need to be close, at a side wall. 
3) Open terminal and type cr -> hit enter
	You will see: "Reseting chunks of POI_NAME "
4)Type cr f -> hit enter
	You will see: "Generating Chunks Around Player "

WHEN TO PERFORM STEPS 5 & 6: If you found a mining teminal that cannot be looted for a chip.

5) Open terminal and type cr -> hit enter
	You will see: "Reseting chunks of POI_NAME "
6) Type cr f -> hit enter
	You will see: "Generating Chunks Around Player "
