VERSION 1.8 RELEASE
=====================================================
Special Parts Craftable 
v1.0
-----------
Overview:
How to explain this mod. This is my way of including the special parts in a more realistic way. I did a crap ton of research and tried to make this mod off of what happens in the real world.

This mod adds two new resources Copper and Zinc. These resources are fully integrated into the game (schematics, progressions, ect) with certain recipes that require a new tool, a Lead Silver Anode. They can be found in world loot, or mined in their raw forms. All of these new items come with custom icons I created.

Another major change is to the Chemistry Station. With this mod the recipe will REQUIRE a new tool, the Lead and Silver Anode. Personally, I love this addition, it adds a fully immersive addition to the game that allows you to create Brass the way it is done in the real world. I even try to get the refining method for Zinc and Copper close to how it's done IRL! Chemistry Station recipe will seem rather different because an intermediate item will need to be created. This is due to the UI limitation of 5 ingredients. That intermediate item is All Chem Station Parts. This is the beaker, cooking pot, and Lead Silver Anode combined just used in the Chem Station Recipe. Comes with a disassemble recipe in case you want the tools back.
Each of the new resources have specific locations to be mined and different patterns of refining. More details in the Interesting Points.

These new resources are used in new recipes for brass, batteries, and even painkillers. All of the items from my other mod All Parts Craftable, that were not true "Parts" items have also been moved to this mod. Those are acid, springs, mechanical/electric parts, polymers ect.

WARNING: One major change that you need to know of is the change to the Campfire. The campfire now uses the new tool, which adds a UI xml change, this is tested and working for me. However, I do not use a UI mod (like SMX UI) so I am concerned this may have issues with those type mods. If you want to test this and it is either working or not PLEASE let me know, I'd feel better knowing that it works or not. 

Interesting points:
Batteries will require copper, even the vanilla recipe.

Copper-
	Refining pattern: Raw Copper -> [Cement Mixer] -> Copper Mix -> [Campfire/Chem Station] -> Scrap Copper
	Mining Location: Can be found with Iron Ore deposits.
Spalerite (Raw Zinc) -
	Refining pattern: Spalerite  -> [Campfire/Chem Station] -> Zinc
  	Mining Location: Occasionally found in sand/gravel in large quantities. Can also be found everywhere in the top soil of the Burnt Forest Biome.

Random Game Tweaks
v1.2
-----------
-Added the ability to pick up farm plots. WARNING: Planted crops will be lost if not harvested before picking up the block.
-Increased the stability glue for gravel, concrete, and metal building blocks. What that means is the blocks can hold more weight before falling. They will still fall if there is too much weight but this feels more realistic when working with metal and concrete. Concrete is especially better now.
	- Gravel: was 4, now 10
	- Metal & metal frame: was 300, now 500
	- Metal Rebar: Was 120, now 300
	- Concrete: was 120, now 300
-Added recipe for the bedroll to be made out of cloth(10) as well. 
-Added recipe to build nails(10) using forged iron(1).
-Added recipe to build darts(5) using forged iron(1).
-Changed the repair kit recipe(essentially back to the old recipe from alpha 16 I think)
	-Was:
	  1 forged iron
	  1 Duct Tape
	-Now:
	  2 forged iron
	  1 Duct Tape	  
	  1 Oil
	  2 Cloth

Medical Additions
v1.1
-----------
-Reduces Aloe Leaf needed to make aloe cream by 2 when a certain perk gets to level 2 (Maybe YeahScience....). Honestly, I'm a little lost on exactly how to determine which perk it goes off of. 
-Increases the stack number for every health type item. 
	- Painkillers: was 10, now 25
	- First Aid Kit: was 5, now 10
	- Bandage: was 10, now 20
	- First Aid Bandage: was 5, now 15

Junk Turret Overhaul:
v1.4
-----------
-Added the junk turret repair kit to world loot.
-Added a slightly better chance to find batteries in world loot. 
-Added a slightly better chance to get batteries from vehicles.

All Parts Craftable
v1.3
-----------
- Fixed a small progressions bug with one of the recipes.
- Moved a bunch of the recipes for Polymers, acid, and others items like that to another mod called Special Parts Craftable.
- This mod now only includes Item Parts such as junk turret parts, steel tool parts ect. 

Jump Pad Additions
v1.1
-----------
-Added recommended Parkour reductions to the jump pads, as they are necessary to maintain a consistant jump height as the Parkour skill increases. Thanks Gothic Shadow for the tip!
